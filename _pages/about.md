excerpt:    About Flask-Diamond
---

Flask-Diamond is a batteries-included Python Flask framework, sortof like Django but radically decomposable. Flask-Diamond offers some opinions about network information systems that process data. Using Flask-Diamond, you can scaffold a working application with sensible defaults, then easily override those defaults to meet your own goals. Flask-Diamond provides a shared vocabulary that helps teams coordinate as they scale up to develop multiple Flask applications while maintaining good code reuse and learning transfer. Flask-Diamond goes beyond a “project scaffold” by providing a complete architecture and team solution, including documentation, tutorials, and other learning support.
